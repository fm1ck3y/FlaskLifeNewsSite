In recent weeks, a growing list of US news media outlets (the Associated Press and Buzzfeed) have announced they are removing the hyphen from the word antisemitism, and turning the two words into one.

Here in Canada, CBC and the Globe and Mail have also updated their style guides to refer to just “antisemitism” or “antisemitic”.Of course, removing the hyphen won’t remove antisemitism from the world, but it will provide a greater understanding of this age-old hatred targeting the Jewish people.
